## 📖 Abstract

Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding.

**HY-Video-PRFL** introduces **Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL)**, a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space. We demonstrate that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding.

**Key advantages:**
- ✅ Efficient latent-space optimization
- ✅ Significant memory savings
- ✅ 1.4X faster training compared to RGB ReFL
- ✅ Better alignment with human preferences


## 🏗️ Model Architecture

![image](assets/method.png)

**Traditional RGB ReFL** relies on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, requiring expensive VAE decoding and confining optimization to late-stage denoising steps.

**Our PRFL approach** leverages pre-trained video generation models as reward models in the noisy latent space. This enables:
- Full-chain gradient backpropagation without VAE decoding
- Early-stage supervision for motion dynamics and structure coherence
- Substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time



## 📊 Performance

### Quantitative Results

Our experiments demonstrate that PRFL achieves substantial motion quality improvements (with +56.00 in dynamic degree, +21.52 in human anatomy and superior alignment with human preferences) as well as significant efficiency gains (with at least 1.4X faster training and notable memory savings).

## 🧱 Download Models

Download the pretrained models before training or inference:

| Model | Resolution | Download Links | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Wan2.1-T2V-14B** | 480P & 720P | 🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B) <br> 🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B) | Text-to-Video model |
| **Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P** | 720P | 🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P) <br> 🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P) | Image-to-Video (High-res) |
| **Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P** | 480P | 🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P) <br> 🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P) | Image-to-Video (Standard) |

First, make sure you have installed the huggingface CLI or modelscope CLI.
```
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
pip install modelscope
```
Then, download the pretrained DiT and VAE checkpoints. For example, you can use the following command to download the WAN2.1 checkpoint of 720P I2V task to ```./weights``` by default.
```
hf download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P --local-dir ./weights/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P
```

## 🎓 Training

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocess on single GPU
```bash
python3 scripts/preprocess/gen_wanx_latent.py --config configs/pre_480.yaml
```

We provide several videos in ```temp_data/videos``` as template training data and an input json file ```temp_data/temp_input_data.json```template for preprocess. ```configs/pre_480.yaml``` is for 480P latent extraction and ```configs/pre_720.yaml``` is for 720P. The ```json_path``` and ```save_dir``` in config file can be customized with your own training data.

### 2️⃣ Data Annotation and Format Conversion

The annotation for reward model (e.g. ```"physics_quality": 1, "human_quality": 1```) should be added in the data meta files (e.g. ```temp_data/480/meta_v1/0004e625d5bcb80130e1ea3d204e2488_meta_v1.json```). Thus we get meta file list ```temp_data/temp_data_480.list``` and ```temp_data/temp_data_720.list``` which can be used in PAVRM and PRFL training.

### 3️⃣ Parallel PAVRM Training on Multiple GPUs

For example, to train PAVRM with 8 GPUs, you can use the following command.

```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port 29500 scripts/pavrm/train_pavrm.py --config configs/train_pavrm_i2v_720.yaml
```

The ```meta_file_list``` and ```val_meta_file_list``` in config file can be customized with your own training and validation data. We provide several config files for different settings t2v or i2v, 480P or 720P. To be noted that, we train PAVRM with ce loss. To train PAVRM with bt loss, you can use the config file of ```configs/train_pavrm_bt_i2v_720.yaml```.

### 4️⃣ Parallel PRFL Training on Multiple GPUs

```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port 29500 scripts/prfl/train_prfl.py --config configs/train_prfl_i2v_720.yaml
```

The ```meta_file_list``` in config file can be customized with your own training data, ```lrm_transformer_path```, ```lrm_mlp_path``` and ```lrm_query_attention_path``` in config file are for your reward model obtained from the previous step. We provide several config files for different settings t2v or i2v, 480P or 720P.


## 🚀 Inference

### 1️⃣ Parallel PAVRM Inference on Multiple GPUs

```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port 29500 scripts/pavrm/inference_pavrm.py --config configs/infer_pavrm_i2v_720.yaml
```

The ```val_meta_file_list``` in config file can be customized with your own inference data, ```resume_transformer_path```, ```resume_mlp_path``` and ```resume_query_attention_path``` in config file are for your reward model to be tested.

### 2️⃣ Parallel PRFL Inference on Multiple GPUs

The PRFL Inference is exactly same as its base model (e.g. Wan2.1).

```bash
export negative_prompt="色调艳丽，过曝，静态，细节模糊不清，字幕，风格，作品，画作，画面，静止，整体发灰，最差质量，低质量，JPEG压缩残留，丑陋的，残缺的，多余的手指，画得不好的手部，画得不好的脸部，畸形的，毁容的，形态畸形的肢体，手指融合，静止不动的画面，杂乱的背景，三条腿，背景人很多，倒着走"
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port 29500 scripts/prfl/inference_prfl.py \
    --dit_fsdp \
    --t5_fsdp \
    --ulysses_size 1 \
    --task "i2v-14B"\
    --ckpt_dir "weights/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P" \
    --lora_path "" \
    --lora_alpha 0 \
    --dataset_path "temp_data/temp_prfl_infer_data.json" \
    --negative_prompt "$negative_prompt" \
    --size "1280*720" \
    --frame_num 81 \

    --save_folder outputs/infer/prfl_i2v_720 \

    --offload_model False
